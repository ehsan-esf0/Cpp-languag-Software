## Do We **Overload** or **Override** Operators in C++?

### 🔹 Short Answer:

> 👉 In C++, **we overload operators**, we **do not override them** — unless it's a very rare case with a virtual operator.

## 🧠 Key Difference Between Overload and Override

| Term         | Meaning                                                                                             | Applies to Operators? |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Overload** | Define a new version of a function or operator with a different signature or for user-defined types | ✅ YES                 |
| **Override** | Redefine a `virtual` function in a derived class                                                    | ❌ NO (in normal use)  |

### ✅ Operator Overloading

This is what we normally do in user-defined classes:

```cpp
class Point {
public:
    int x, y;

    Point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}

    // Overload the + operator
    Point operator+(const Point& other) const {
        return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y);
    }
};
```

Here we are **overloading** the `+` operator to work with the `Point` class.
This is **not** overriding because there's no virtual function being redefined.

---

### ❌ What is Operator Overriding Then?

Technically, operator **overriding** can happen **only if the base class defines a virtual operator** and the derived class overrides it.

Example:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual bool operator==(const Base&) const {
        return true;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    bool operator==(const Base&) const override {
        return false;
    }
};
```

But this is **very rare**. Most of the time when we define operators for our own classes, we are **overloading**, not overriding.

## 🔍 Why the Confusion?

You might feel like you are "rewriting" or "replacing" the operator, and in a sense you are — but from the compiler's point of view:

* ✅ You are **adding a new version of the operator** → **Overload**
* ❌ You are **not replacing a virtual function in inheritance** → Not **Override**

---

## 🧩 Final Summary:

> ✅ **We overload operators in C++.**
>
> ❌ We do not override them — unless in rare cases involving virtual operator functions.
