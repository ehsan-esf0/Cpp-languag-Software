## ✅ Part 1: Getting a pointer to the internal data of a `std::vector`

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30};
int* p = v.data();   // or: int* p = &v[0];
```

Now `p` points to the array inside the vector.

### Difference between `v.data()` and `&v[0]`:

* Both are almost equivalent, but:

  * `v.data()` is safer (works even if the vector is empty).
  * `&v[0]` causes undefined behavior if the vector is empty.

---

## ✅ Part 2: Using `std::vector` as a replacement for C-style arrays

Suppose you have a function that takes a pointer to an array:

```cpp
void sumArray(int* arr, int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        sum += arr[i];
    std::cout << "Sum = " << sum << "\n";
}
```

You can call it using a vector’s internal data:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
sumArray(v.data(), v.size());  // 👈 passing pointer and size
```

---

## ✅ Part 3: Vectors of pointers (`std::vector<T*>`)

A vector can hold pointers itself, for example to dynamically allocated objects or variables:

### Example with pointers to regular variables:

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 20;
std::vector<int*> vp = {&a, &b};
*vp[0] = 100;  // changes a’s value
std::cout << a << "\n";  // prints 100
```

### Example with pointers to objects:

```cpp
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
};

Person* p1 = new Person{"Ali", 22};
Person* p2 = new Person{"Sara", 19};

std::vector<Person*> people = {p1, p2};

for (auto ptr : people)
    std::cout << ptr->name << " is " << ptr->age << " years old\n";
```

⛔ **Important:** If you use `new`, remember to `delete` or better use smart pointers.

---

## ✅ Part 4: Dangers of pointers after resizing a vector

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
int* p = v.data();    // pointer to first element

v.push_back(4);       // 👈 vector may reallocate memory!

std::cout << *p;      // ❌ pointer may be invalid (dangling pointer)
```

### Safe practice:

Every time you potentially resize, re-get the pointer:

```cpp
p = v.data();  // get the new address
```

---

## ✅ Part 5: Pointer to a vector or vector of vectors

### 1. Pointer to the vector itself:

```cpp
std::vector<int>* pv = new std::vector<int>{10, 20};
(*pv)[0] = 100;
delete pv;  // don’t forget to free memory
```

### 2. Vector of vectors (dynamic 2D array)

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(3, std::vector<int>(4, 0));
// matrix[1][2] = 5;
```

This is much safer than using `int**` and the vector manages the memory for you.

## ✅ Pro tips summary

| Point             | Explanation                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `v.data()`        | Pointer to vector’s internal array           |
| `&v[0]`           | Similar, but unsafe if vector is empty       |
| `std::vector<T*>` | Vector of pointers (to objects or variables) |
| Resizing vector   | Old pointers may become invalid              |
| Vector of vectors | Safe, modern way for 2D dynamic arrays       |

## Why is `int* ptr = new int[10]` like a raw array, but vector is different?

* `ptr` is a pointer directly to a continuous block of memory on the heap.
* `std::vector<int> v(10)` is an **object** that internally manages a pointer, size, capacity, etc.
* `ptr[i]` is direct memory access.
* `v[i]` calls the vector’s `operator[]` which accesses the internal memory.

---

## Why can't we do `pv[0]` instead of `(*pv)[0]` for a pointer to vector?

Given:

```cpp
std::vector<int>* pv = new std::vector<int>{10, 20, 30};
```

* `(*pv)[0]` means: dereference pointer to get vector, then get element 0.
* `pv[0]` means: treat `pv` as a pointer to an array of vectors and get the first vector (which is `*pv`).
* But you want the element inside the vector, so use `(*pv)[0]`.
